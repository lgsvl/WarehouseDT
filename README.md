This repository contains the code and assets for a sample 3D warehouse digital twin environment for use with SVL Simulator for indoor simulations (eg: Robotics).

It contains basic objects in a virtual world which can be used to test robots in indoor enviornments to confirm robotics functionality and perform sanity checks. It also serves as an example for how to create a custom 3D indoor environment for SVL Simulator.
